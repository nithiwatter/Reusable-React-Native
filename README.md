# Reusuable-React-Native
A playground for learning React-Native - prebuilt with a lot of custom made resuable components to allow faster frontend design (ex. common components such as Block, Card, Typography, and Form).

Now include integration with Firebase web SDK (both normal and Google Provider authentication + easily extensible with other Providers such as Facebook or Github). Allow uploading profile picture (saved as a blob in Firebase Storage), and automatically add user to both Firebase Authentication and Firebase Firestore.
